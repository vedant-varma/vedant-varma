# Hi, I'm Vedant Varma! 👋

## 🌟 About Me

I was born in New Delhi, India, and moved to the Abu Dhabi, UAE at the age of 9. I grew up in a multinationl and culturally diverse environment and hence developed an immense passion for languages and the different cultures of the world. 

I'm a Computer Science major with a Minor in Economics at Rutgers University, deeply passionate about the intersection of technology and finance. My journey in tech started with my passion for video games and building computers. Throughout my academic and project experiences, I've explored areas like AI, software engineering, and fintech, aiming to leverage these technologies to solve real-world challenges. 

Beyond coding, I'm an enthusiast of exploring ancient history, gaming, and custom PC building. Every year I travel by myself to remote locations all around the world that still have reminiscents of the ancient past. I love reading different scriptures of different mythologies and going to remote locatoins with arhcaelogical ruins (especially the ones all across India!). I am also extremely passionate about video games and PC building, and as a result a lot of my free time is spent either researching ancient civilizations or playing a competitive FPS game.

## 🛠 Projects

### StockAdvisorAI
- I created this stock analyzer to access real time stock data using the Yahoo Finance API and used libraries such as MatPlot to graph stock prices based on real time par. I then integrated the AI API into this project to answer queries regarding metrics.
- The AI API also helps with metric and price analysis.
- Demo Video available.

### WhatsApp FinBot
- I have created an AI-powered chatbot for financial inquiries, built with JavaScript and leveraging Twilio and OpenAI APIs. This was a demo that I used to pitch my idea to client companies to integrate AI into a chatbot system which was implemented later on.

### BondIntel-AI
- A bond analyzer using Python and Java, incorporating GPT-3.5 for securities analysis. More information is present within the repo.

### Gyankosh
- Currently, I am working on a digital library for ancient Indian scriptures, utilizing Java, Python, SQL, and React.js. My goal is to leverage OpenAI's GPT-4 capabilities to provide users with deep and enriched analysis of any verse within the scripture.
- As of now, I have created an MVP of the project which is able to use Tesseract OCR to extract text from the Devanagari script and parse it to the AI API to create an analysis of the scripture. A LOT MORE EXCITING THINGS TO COME!!
